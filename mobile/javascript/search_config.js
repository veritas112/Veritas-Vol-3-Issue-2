The participants gained valuable              insights into the theory, practical aspects, and diverse applications of              FTIR/ATR in scientific research and forensic investigations. The hands-on               sessions with the FTIR instrument provided them with the necessary skills to              incorporate FTIR/ATR techniques into their teaching and research activities               effectively.                 The Department of Forensic Science received positive feedback from the              participants, expressing their gratitude for organizing such an informative               workshop. The event successfully fostered interdisciplinary collaboration              among the faculties of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences, paving the way for              potential joint research projects and academic endeavors.

Steganography is the Greek word in which ‘Steganos’ means covered or hidden                and ‘Graphein’ means to write. Secret writing cannot be seen with the naked               eye, but it can be revealed through various methods, such as keeping it under                appropriate light, applying heat to the writing, and spraying specific chemicals               onto the writing.               Invisible inks are used to do secret writing, these writings are done using various                inks such as vinegar, lime juice, saliva, sweat, etc., These solutions absorb the               paper, and the writings made through them turn transparent in colour.                Invisible  inks  can  be  categorised  into  three  types:  writings,  which  can  be               deciphered by heat mechanisms, chemicals, and ultraviolet rays.

This  leads  to  the  release  of  carbon  atoms,               which in turn react with oxygen atoms, and an oxidation reaction occurs. This              oxidation process produces a yellow-to-brown colour, which is imparted to the               writings. Thus revealing the information.                 MATERIALS REQUIRED                 1. Invisible inks such as milk, lime juice, baking soda, and saliva.                 2. Heat applications include candles, heat burners, and electric irons.                3. Miscellaneous-Q-Tips Buds, Paper, and Pencil.                 METHODOLOGY                A total of three samples containing hidden messages were inked using different              inks, including saliva and milk (biological fluid), baking soda (chemical fluid),               and  lime  juice  (vegetable  fluid).  The  writings  were  created  by  dipping  cotton              swabs  or  earbuds  in  different  types  of  fluids.  After  being  kept  at  room               temperature for a while, the samples were analysed.

These messages can be deciphered by a variety              of methods, such as the application of heat, the observation of the document               under  UV  light,  and  the  treatment  of  the  document  with  chemicals  such  as              phenolphthalein  and  iodine.  In  this  study,  the  writings  were  deciphered  by               visualising them under UV light and heat.              Hidden messages were only revealed in the chemical treatment of secret writings               when treated with iodine solution, and no changes or results were observed in              the treatment of the paper with phenolphthalein.

Endangered species are                 poached for meat due to cultural beliefs and traditions, exotic delicacies, and                the illegal wildlife trade, in which the animals are killed, and their meat is                 sold on the black market to meet the demand from consumers.                   Continuous poaching of species is a major threat to biodiversity, which may                lead to further endangerment of species. Mostly, pangolins, cape pangolins,                 turtles,  sharks,  tokay  geckos,  tortoises,  eagles,  hawks,  owls,  ducks,  geese,                songbirds,  parrots,  quails,  pheasants,  and  other  exotic  birds  are  illegally                 poached  for  meat.  To  control  such  illegal  poaching,  law  enforcement                agencies appointed many volunteers to collect information on illegal wildlife                 trade  and  trafficking,  and  they  often  raided  restaurants  and  markets  to                 identify the selling and use of illegally poached meat.                  However,  the  major  issue  they  face  during  such  raids  is  the  species                 identification of meat. It is sometimes a challenge for officials to identify the                 species using morphological traits, especially when the samples are too old,                degraded,  or  cooked.  Generally,  DNA-based  identification  using                 mitochondrial genes like Col, Cytochrome B, 16S rRNA, and 12S rRNA is a                useful tool for species identification.                   Here’s a case study in which species identification was done from a sample of                 cooked meat.

The suspect (the restaurant                 owner) was booked under the charges of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,                suspecting the seized meat was of STL origin (a species of target concern)                 since the officials received reports of illegal poaching of STL in the last few                years for local consumption. The fully cooked meat sample was sent to the                 Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata, for species identification.                   STEPS INVOLVED:                       The  meat  is  washed  with  1×  sterile  phosphate  buffered  saline  (PBS)                     overnight to remove all the remains of spices and condiments.                    A small pinch of flesh from the innermost layer of the sample is taken.                     Isolation  of  genomic  DNA  is  carried  out  through  the  QiAmp  DNA-                    investigator kit (Qiagen Germany).                     Universal primer sets of Cytochrome b and 12S rRNA genes are used to                    amplify approximately 400 bp fragments of both mitochondrial genes.                     Sanger sequencing, also known as chain-termination sequencing, which                    is  a  method  used  to  determine  the  sequence  of  nucleotides  in  a  DNA                     molecule,  was  carried  out  on  the  Genetic  Analyzer  3730.  Sequence                    quality was checked and validated using sequencer V4.7.                     Homologous  sequences  were  downloaded  from  the  NCBI/BLAST                    database,  and  multiple  sequence  alignment  was  performed  by  the                     CLUSTALW algorithm in MegaX.                     Best fit models were identified using Bayesian Information Centre (BIC)                    values for all the downloaded and generated sequences, and maximum                    likelihood  trees  were  constructed  in  MEGA  X  using  the  Hasegawa-                     Kishino-Yano model (HKY + G) and Tamura-Nei model with a gamma                     distribution for cytochrome b and 12S rRNA gene sequences.                    The  generated  sequences  were  submitted  to  the  GENBANK/NCBI                     database with accession numbers MH423749 and MH423716.

The suspected material was compared with STL, but the similarity was                      just  79%,  which  was  only  for  cytochrome  b,  and  no  further  data  was                       available for the 12S rRNA gene sequence in the database. But on the                      contrary,  there  was  a  99%  similarity  of  the  suspected  material’s                       generated sequences with Common Quail (Coturnix).                      The  results  from  these  databases  indicated  that  the  suspected  material                       was a Common Quail and not the STL.                     FURTHER  PROCEEDINGS  AND  IMPORTANCE  OF  MOLECULAR                  DIAGNOSTICS :                    Since the genetic analysis proved that the suspected material was not STL,                  the statement of the suspect was found to be true, and the allegations against                 him proved to be wrong.                    Thus,  the  molecular  diagnostics  tool  in  species  identification  helped  law                  enforcement  officials  withdraw  the  charges  of  illegal  poaching  against  the                 suspect.

Later,  he  shifted  to                 London and worked as a journalist and broadcaster for BBC World Services                (1972). Between the years 1975 and 1978, Markov worked on his In Absentia                 Reports, an analysis of life in Communist Bulgaria.

While waiting for the bus, all of a sudden he felt a                 harsh  pain  in  his  right  leg,  like  an  insect  bite  or  sting.  When  he  turned                  around, he saw a man picking up his umbrella from the ground, hurriedly                 crossing the road, and taking a cab. Later, when he arrived at his workplace,                  he noticed a small red pimple in the place where he got stung earlier, and the                 pain hadn’t lessened or stopped. He told the morning incident to one of his                  friends, Theo Lirkov, who works at BBC World Services with him.                 Later on in the evening, Markov developed a high fever and was taken and                  admitted  to  the  hospital,  where  he  died  four  days  later,  on  September  11,                 1978 (49 years old).                     Later investigation and aftermath                 Bernard Riley, the assisting physician for Markov, suggested many causes of                  his  death,  including  a  venomous  snake  bite.  Due  to  circumstances  and                 suggestions given by Markov, the doctors had a suspicion that he had been                  poisoned; hence, the metropolitan police ordered an autopsy on Markov’s                 body, which resulted in finding out that acute poisoning was the reason for                  his death.

Suspect                 Francesco Gullino was the primary suspect who was tracked down after 35                  years of murder in Austria. Investigators suspected him at that time because                  he was the only agent at the time of Markov’s murder. He left the place after                 the day of Markov’s murder and later received a payment of 30,000 euros                 from the agency he worked for. He didn’t admit the accusation. Hence, the                  case is still open, and no one was arrested in this case.

A forensic linguist analyses language in written or recorded              accoutrements to help in the disquisition of crimes. To evaluate genuineness and              guarantee  clarification,  a  forensic  linguist  examines  vernacular,  grammar,               phonetics,  sentence  form,  and  other  verbal  disciplines.  Forensic  linguistics  is              categorised  into  three  primary  fields  of  study:  The  language  employed  in               legislation  (for  example,  the  connotation  of  a  legislation  might  influence              someone’s judgement).                 The language engaged in the legal and forensic processes (for example, did the               police  use  leading  questions  during  questioning?).  Linguistic  evidence  (for              example,  collating  writing  styles  in  given  evidence  to  the  accused’s  writing              styles).                LINGUISTIC EVIDENCE                 A  content  with  smatter  valid  importance  might  get  hold  of  many  numerous              shapes  for  police  officers,  private  detectives,  private  investigators,  certainty               professionals,  intelligence  analysts,  attorneys,  and  commoners.  Well-defined              category  of  linguistic  evidence,  such  as  logos,  label  marks,  and  copyright               applications,  are  thoroughly  associated  with  exceptional  civil  litigations.              Smatter  category  of  linguistic  affirmation  are  also  seen  in  particular  criminal               plots: a bank pilfering note, a warning letter, a self- murder note, or a pay-off              note.  It  is  noticeable  from  these  types  of  papers  that  linguistic  evidence  may              play a remarkable part in inquiring a crime, and the litigation with which such a               legal paper is associated is also obvious (although this type of document is at              times used to conceal a different sort of crime). n real situations, for example, a               self-murder note has been made to distort or conceal a murder; a warning letter              has been issued to reroute investigators away from intriguers.

Drones,  or  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs),  initially               captured  public  fascination  with  their  ability  to  provide  aerial  views  for              photographers,  aid  in  surveying  landscapes,  and  assist  in  various  industries.               However,  this  once-benign  technology  has  evolved  into  a  potential  threat  as              individuals  with  malicious  intent  exploit  the  capabilities  of  drones  for  illicit               activities. The term \"rogue drones\" refers to unmanned aerial vehicles that are              utilized  for  unauthorized  and  often  nefarious  purposes.  This  misuse  has               escalated  beyond  simple  privacy  concerns  to  more  severe  security  threats,              including  industrial  espionage,  smuggling  of  contraband,  and  even  potential               terrorist attacks. The ability of rogue drones to operate discreetly and in areas              difficult  to  access  by  conventional  means  elevates  their  threat  level,               necessitating robust countermeasures.                 In response to the escalating risks posed by rogue drones, the field of forensic               security has emerged as a critical player in safeguarding against these potential              threats. Forensic security involves the application of scientific methodologies to               analyze,  interpret,  and  secure  evidence  related  to  criminal  activities.  In  the              context of rogue drones, forensic security plays a pivotal role in developing and               deploying technologies that can detect, mitigate, and investigate unauthorized              drone activities.                 THE RISE OF ROGUE DRONES                 The rise of rogue drones signifies a paradigm shift in the use of technology for               purposes  beyond  their  intended  design.  Once  hailed  for  their  innovative              applications across various sectors, drones have now become tools of choice for               individuals  with  malicious  intent.  This  section  delves  into  the  multifaceted              aspects  of  the  increasing  misuse  of  drones  and  how  these  unmanned  aerial              vehicles have been transformed from instruments of convenience to potential               threats to security and privacy. The evolution of drones into rogue entities is              marked  by  their  adaptation  for  illicit  purposes,  ranging  from  covert               surveillance  to  activities  that  breach  legal  and  ethical  boundaries.  This              unprecedented misuse has been fueled by the accessibility and affordability of               drones,  allowing  even  non-experts  to  acquire  and  operate  these  devices  for              unauthorized activities.

Radio  Frequency  (RF)  Jamming:  This  tool  disrupts  the                         communication between a drone and its operator by essentially                          pressing a \"pause\" button on the drone.                         Directed Energy Weapons and Capture Technologies: These are                          superhero  gadgets  that  either  use  special  beams  to  disable  a                         drone without hurting it or physically catch the drone using nets                          or other drones.                        DRONE DETECTION SYSTEMS:                           Radar (like superhero eyes): Radar watches the sky and tells us                          if there's a drone flying where it shouldn't be. It even gives us                         details, like how fast it's going and how high it is.                          Acoustic  Sensors  (like  superhero  ears):  These  sensors  listen  to                         the  sounds  drones  make.  If  a  drone  is  sneaking  around,  these                          sensors can pick up its noise.                         Radio Frequency Scanners (like superhero spy gadgets): These                          scanners eavesdrop on the signals drones use to talk with their                         controllers. They help us locate where the drone operator might                         be.                          Superpower: They help us know when and where rogue drones                         are flying.                        RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) JAMMING:                        RF jammers emit signals that mess with the communication between                      a drone and its operator, confusing the drone's navigation systems.                     However, just like superheroes have rules, using RF jamming comes                     with rules too. It can't be used everywhere because it                      might also affect other devices nearby, like phones or radios.

Directed  Energy  Weapons                   (like a superhero laser): These weapons use special beams to disable                  a drone without destroying it. Capture Technologies (like superhero                  nets): Nets or other drones are used to catch a rogue drone in mid-                   air, bringing it down gently. Superpower: They offer a precise way                  to stop rogue drones without causing too much harm.                                                                                   Image 2: A picture of a flying drone                     Each  of  these  tools  has  its  strengths.  Some  are  good  at  spotting                   drones,  while  others  are  better  at  stopping  them.  But,  like  all                  superheroes,  these  tools  have  limits.  For  example,  RF  jamming                   might  interfere  with  other  devices,  and  directed  energy  weapons                  work  better  in  certain  conditions.  In  summary,  counter-drone                   technology is like our superhero team, equipped with different tools                  to protect the sky from rogue drones.

Consumers  or  clients,  creditors,  investors,  other  firms,  and  ultimately  the               crime's  originating  company  and  its  staff  are  the  victims  of  corporate  fraud.              Fraudulent accounting techniques are a common component of corporate fraud               schemes,  which  aim  to  inflate  a  company's  perceived  profitability.  Corporate              fraud  may  also  result  from  product  flaws  or  issues  that  a  company  seeks  to              conceal.  The  government's  regulatory  agencies  work  to  prevent,  identify,  and               penalise  corporate  fraud  through  laws  and  regulations.  Corporate  fraud              incidents have been reported on a number of occasions as a result of the growth               of massive, multinational organisations and conglomerates.                The Satyam Computer (Satyam) Case: The Satyam fraud exposed the gaps in               India's corporate governance laws once more, and SEBI's negligence once more              proved  to  be  disastrous  for  small  investors.  Here,  B  Ramalinga  Raju,  the               company's  founder  and  previous  chairman,  and  his  brother  B  Rama  Raju              deceived the board, investors, and other shareholders. The company's financial               situation and investment were misrepresented in its accounts. By falsifying the              amount in the books of accounts, Mr. Ramalinga embezzled money from the               firm and invested in real estate around the country. As a result, the company's              share price skyrocketed but its core values stayed the same. Mr. Ramalinga was              eventually found guilty of this because he was unable to sell the properties he               held to close the gaps in the books of account due to the real estate market's              decline  in  value.  Rs.  7,136  crores  were  lost  in  the  Satyam  scam.    The  fraud               revealed  a  network  of  individuals,  ranging  from  auditors  to  the  board  of              directors, who helped to enable the crime.

Ineffective board of directors: The board of directors exhibited impartiality                    and was unable to effectively supervise the management.                   Regulatory  shortcomings:  At  the  time,  the  regulatory  framework  was                    insufficient to stop the companies’ misconduct.                   The  relevance  of  independent  directors:  The  significance  of  independent                    directors  on  the  board  of  directors  was  brought  to  light  by  the  Satyam                   controversy.               Need  for  whistleblowing  techniques:  Whistleblowing  strategies  are  necessary              since it is imposed upon employees to disclose unethical behavior.                 PRECAUTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN :                       Establish  an  anti-fraud  policy  and  ensure  that  all  staff  members  are                   informed about it.                    Regularly check your financial accounts through audits.                   Encourage staff members to report any unusual activities.                    Stay up to date on any legal developments that might impact your business.

CONCLUSION :                 The field of corporate governance and leadership is intricate and multifaceted.              Although it is the CEO's and chairman's responsibility to lead their company to               success,  they  risk  serious  repercussions  if  they  act  unethically  or  illegally.              Corporate frauds and scandals have the potential to cause losses in the billions               of  dollars,  legal  troubles,  and  a  decline  in  the  company's  reputation.  Many              nations have responded by putting legislative frameworks and controls in place               to attempt and stop corporate wrongdoing, although these steps are not always              successful.  Corporate  scandals  have  an  international  influence  and  can  have              serious repercussions for the firm as well as its stakeholders, workers, clients,               and investors.

The  continuous  efforts  made  in  recent  decades  in              establishing  a  widely  accepted  approach  has  resulted  in  this  fruitful  method               called  Chemometrics  which  involves  statistical  inference,  allowing  more              improved probabilistic interpretation. It can help visualise complex analytical              data in a simpler and more convenient manner. As we evolve into the modern               world, the amount of data that is generated everywhere is vast. Almost every              process is computerised and visualised, and there is necessity for the forensic               scientist to understand these complex tools for viewing the collected data more              seamlessly.  In  simple  words  chemometrics  is  the  integration  of  statistics,              mathematics  and  computational  methods  to  extract  relevant  chemical               information from complex data obtained during investigation.                 2. CHEMOMETRIC METHODS                 Techniques in chemometrics varies based on the application on which it is being              used.  There  are  three  different  methods,  Pattern  Recognition,  which  is               subdivided  into  Unsupervised  and  Supervised  method,  Regression  Technique              and Experimental Design met                 2.1 Pattern Recognition:              2.1.1 Unsupervised Pattern Recognition               This method mainly involves detecting patterns in the datasets of the collected              samples without any predefined labels or outcomes, with the help of algorithms               which  largely  decreases  human  error.  This  method  also  allows  comparative              analysis  with  a  process  of  projecting  the  new  samples  onto  the  previously               collected samples. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) which involves merging              data  into  large  clusters  based  on  special  distance  and  relative  similarities,              Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  which  uses  dimensionality  reduction               technique  to  offer  visual  representation  of  the  data  are  examples  of              Unsupervised Pattern Recognition technique.               2.1.2 Supervised Pattern Recognition              In a supervised method, data used involves labelled data. As the name suggests               it involves human intervention which makes it more reliable and acceptable in              the  court  of  law  as  there  is  a  proof  that  the  process  has  been  done  under               authorised supervision.

Choosing the required parameters and analytical               data  from  large  sample  evidences  with  at  most  care  is  crucial  for  the  final              output.  Here  comes  the  role  of  Experimental  Design  Techniques,  offering               various  tools  and  techniques  such  as  sample  preparation,  sample  storage,              parameters for instrumental analysis, etc. which helps in identifying, optimising               data  and  modelling  factors  that  are  involved  in  effective  completion  of  the              process.                 3.

By               analysing  dental  evidence  in  various  circumstances,  the  forensic  odontologist              supports  law  enforcement  agencies.  Each  person's  dental  pattern  is  different.               Therefore, if data are available for the purpose, a person's dentition can be used              for individual identification and comparison. The main benefit of this evidence               is  that,  similar  to  other  hard  tissues,  it  is  frequently  maintained  until  death.               When  it  comes  to  decomposing,  burned,  or  skeletonized  remains,  forensic              odontology  is  indispensable  when  standard  identification  techniques  like               fingerprints  and  visual  recognition  are  not  possible.  In  recent  times,  forensic              dentistry has become a developing science and is very important to society.                 ROLE OF FORENSIC ODONTOLOGY:                 Forensic odontology has various roles, such as:               Identification of human remains: Dental records should preferably be collected              and  matched  to  those  of  the  unidentified  person  in  order  to  identify  human               remains based on their teeth. Age and tooth eruption are somewhat correlated,              thereby providing a preliminary victim estimate.               Age estimation: The degree to which crown and root structures have formed, the              eruption  stage,  and  the  intermixture  of  primary  and  adult  dentitions  are  all               taken into consideration when determining an individual's age.          VERITAS VOLUME: 3, ISSUE: 2                                                WRITER: VARUN SAI S","66                    Identification following mass fatalities: The procedure for identifying a deceased              person in a mass disaster is similar to that of ordinary dental identification, but               is  much  more  complicated.  In  situations  involving  fire  or  severe  trauma,              physical features are often destroyed. Teeth can resist fire and a great majority               of traumas as they are heavily calcified.              Assessment of abuse cases: When faced with uncommon oral injuries, the dentist               should be on the lookout for signs of abuse of children, the elderly, or spouses.              The  dentist  should  keep  accurate  and  thorough  records  of  all  findings  for               review by law enforcement authorities.                TECHNIQUES USED IN FORENSIC ODONTOLOGY:                 In forensic dentistry, various techniques are used, such as:                    Bite mark analysis: Bite marks can be used to identify suspects in criminal                   cases.  Recent  techniques  that  have  improved  bite  mark  identification                    include  the  use  of  electron  microscopy  and  computer  enhancement                   technique.                    Teeth prints: Ameloblasts lay down the enamel rods in an undulating and                   intertwining path. The ends of a sequence of neighbouring enamel rods are                    reflected in patterns on the enamel’s surface. Amelogyphics is the study of                   these enamel rod patterns. Enamel can withstand deterioration, so it can be                    used as an identification tool for burned or decomposed bodies.                   Radiography:  If  sufficient  antemortem  records  are  available,  using                    radiographs  for  identification  is  valuable.  From  the  radiographs,  several                   morphological and pathological changes may be examined. Identity is aided                    by the morphology of the root and crown.                   Dental DNA analysis: Teeth can be an excellent source of DNA. The use of                    the technique based on Polymerase Chain Reaction, that enables a minute                    quantity of DNA to be amplified, has acquired great importance in post-                   mortem analysis in forensic cases.                    Dental record: Dental records must be maintained and kept up to date. This                   is  a  dentist's  responsibility,  as  it  provides  patients  and  dentists  with                    information  for  administrative,  forensic,  and  medico-legal  needs.  Dental                   data were effectively used in several disasters, including the December 2004                    tsunami in the Indian Ocean and the World Trade Center tragedy.

Lip  prints  are                    sufficient  for  forensic  investigations  since  they  also  have  grooves  and                   furrows on the surface.                    Rugoscopy: The study of the patterns of the grooves and ridges (rugae) of                   the palate to identify individual patterns is called Rugoscopy. These rugae                    are thought to be unique to individuals, and the pattern can be a credible                   indicator in postmortem situations.                 CONCLUSION:                 A relatively new area of dentistry with a lot of prospective for growth is forensic               odontology. Forensic odontologists are crucial in the examination and analysis               of dental evidence at the crime scene. It is imperative for every practitioner to              understand  the  forensic  implications  of  their  profession.  It  is  one  of  the               emerging fields of dentistry that supports several medico-legal investigations as              well  as  the  identification  of  victims  of  mass  disasters.

Due to those trying to take advantage of weaknesses in passport and              visa systems, there is a greater chance of travel document fraud as a result of the               growth  in  international  travel.The  use  of  forged  or  fraudulent  documents  to               fool immigration officials and obtain unapproved entry into or travel within a              nation is known as travel document fraud. Passports, visas, and other identity               documents are the travel documents that are most frequently falsified. Travel              document  fraudsters  frequently  try  to  make  counterfeits  or  modify  authentic               documents by taking advantage of holes in these documents' security measures.              To identify and stop travel document fraud, authorities around the world use a               variety  of  strategies,  such  as  cutting-edge  document  authentication              technologies,  biometric  verification,  and  international  collaboration.               Improvements  to  travel  document  and  border  control  system  security  are              important due to the constant development of fraudulent schemes.

Counterfeit Travel Documents: The unauthorized replication of a legitimate                   document is known as counterfeiting.                  2. Forgery: Forgery is the forging or falsification of a genuine document and                   the unauthorized alteration of a document to provide misleading information                  about the ownership or validity of a passport.                   3. Identity theft : Identity fraud refers to the illicit use of legitimate papers,                  involving impersonation and illegally obtained documents.

Pseudo Documents: These documents seem authentic but do not attempt               to recreate the original.               Pseudo documents commonly take the form of:              • Fake documents issued by fake states or organisations.               • A document from a dissolved or renamed state.              • Fabricated papers that utilise the name of a real state or institution but lack a               valid counterpart.              The  most  commonly  used  document  to  commit  travel  document  fraud  is  the               passport,  in  a  survey  conducted  in  2019  shows  73%  of  document  frauds              committed were on passports.               Security agencies use various methods to detect travel documents frauds, which              includes  technological  advancements  such  as  biometric  verification  and               machine-readable characteristics, have improved the detection of fake papers.

And              traditional methods where the Passport check personnel use visual examination               and manual scrutiny to detect travel document fraud. This procedure, however,              has numerous barriers and is not a very effective method to detect and prevent               travel  document  fraud.  For  example;  if  the  person  looks  different  in  real  life              and the photo, due to maybe the picture was clicked a few years ago and he/she               may  claim  to  have  had  a  glow-up  and  changed  over  time,  it  can  either  be  a              genuine case but there might be instances the traveller has some criminal intent.

The accused a native of Mirzapur village under               Badgaon police station, was motivated to pursue an abroad education, but his               academic gap years (he finished class 12 in 2013) made it difficult for him to              secure  a  visa  appropriately.  Sachin  obtained  a  counterfeit  passport  using  his              brother  Gautam's  credentials  in  April  2022,  and  then  got  a  study  visa  to               Singapore. He left for Singapore in June 2022. The counterfeit was discovered               last  year,  in  March,  when  Gautam  filed  for  a  passport  to  visit  Dubai.  But,              astonishingly,  he  discovered  that  a  passport  had  already  been  granted  in  his               name. He reported the scam to the regional passport office in Ghaziabad, which              transferred the case to the Saharanpur police.

CONCLUSION                 Travel  document  fraud  is  a  chronic  and  multidimensional  issue  that  poses              severe  dangers  to  global  security  and  border  control  systems.  The  changing               terrain  of  fraudulent  operations  continuously  tests  authorities'  attempts  to              detect and prohibit the unauthorised use of passports, visas, and other identity               papers.  International  collaboration,  information  exchange,  and  the              implementation  of  standardised  identification  methods  are  all  critical               components  of  a  strong  defence  against  cross-border  criminal  networks.  To               dismantle  these  networks,  law  enforcement  authorities  throughout  the  world              must work together. Finally, combating travel document fraud is a communal               effort  that  necessitates  the  dedication  and  participation  of  governments,              international organisations, and technological innovators.

The  discipline  of              forensic  anthropology  is  essential  to  disaster  relief  efforts  because  it  offers               expertise and tools that boost the precision and efficacy of techniques used to              identify victims of large-scale casualties. Generally speaking, a mass disaster is               defined  as  an  incident  (air,  marine,  railway,  or  motorway  accident,  flooding,              earthquake,  etc.)  that  leaves  a  huge  number  of  victims  that  require               identification and medical-legal inquiry. The victim's remains obtained from a               mass  disaster  will  be  in  a  dreadful  condition  often  burned  or  dismembered.              Forensic anthropologists have been using their knowledge of disaster victim              identification (DVI) for more than a century. However, in recent years, several               catastrophic incidents have led to an increased role for forensic anthropologists               in these investigations the objectives are to support human remains identificatio         VERITAS VOLUME: 3, ISSUE: 2                           WRITER: SASHA VASSULA FERNANDES","72                  and to figure out what had occurred to the remains, particularly in light of any              possible foul play evidence. The material analyzed typically comprises of mostly               or  entirely  skeletonized  remains,  or  skeletal  evidence  that  has  been  extracted              from  fleshy  remains.  The  forensic  anthropologists  can  use  their  specialised               knowledge and techniques to re-examine skeletal remains and provide crucial               insights  into  the  circumstances  surrounding  an  individual's  death.  The              applications  of  forensic  anthropology  in  mass  disasters  and  cold  cases  are               therefore vital in ensuring justice, closure, and accountability. From a medical-              legal standpoint, the study of human remains has three primary goals: a well-               executed  crime  scene  investigation,  including  appropriate  methods  for              recovering  and  registering  human  remains  and  applying  appropriate               identification  protocols.  To  verify  the  identities  of  people  and  speed  up  the              repatriation  process,  they  use  methods  like  skeletal  analysis,  DNA  testing,               dental  record  comparison,  and  facial  reconstruction.  The  application  of  this              field  in  mass  disasters  can  be  traced  back  from  the  identification  of  victims               during the 1950 Korean War.                 TECHNIQUES USED IN FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY                 One might think of mass disasters as either \"open\" or \"closed\" systems. The first               is a method where a predetermined number of people are known to be involved,              like in the case of an airline accident involving a passenger list. In this instance,              the  effort  mostly  entails  comparing  postmortem  (PM)  data  from  the  victims               with  antemortem  (AM)  data  of  the  people  on  the  passenger  list.  Conversely,               managing  an  open  system  is  far  more  challenging.  This  is  the  situation,  for              example, when an explosion occurs in a train station or underground, or when a               sinking ship has illegal immigrants on board (and so no official passenger list).              Hence,  keeping  the  classification  of  mass  disasters  in  mind,  Forensic               Anthropologists  will  accordingly  decide  on  how  to  go  about  with  victim              identification. One of the preliminary methods used for victim identification in               mass  disasters  and  cold  cases  is  Osteometric  techniques  wherein  the  experts              estimate  the  height  and  body  mass  of  individuals  based  on  skeletal  remains.               These techniques involve the measurements of various bones such as the cranial              bones  to  establish  the  correlations  between  the  bone  lengths  and  body               dimensions. Other procedures involve the Comparison and superimposition of               Skeletal remains. In this process, the skeletal remains are subjected to a        VERITAS VOLUME: 3, ISSUE: 2                            WRITER: SASHA VASSULA FERNANDES","73                 postmortem  radiograph,  which  is  orientated  in  a  position  comparable  to  the              antemortem  image  using  progressive  approximations.  The  goal  is  to  obtain             equivalent ratios between lines drawn between various places on a transverse              and  coronal  plane.  Next,  the  ratios  are  computed.  Until  a  placement  is              determined  that  yields  ratios  that  can  be  superimposed  to  those  of  the             antemortem  radiological  picture,  the  skeletal  remains  are  radiographed  in              various postures, similar to those of the antemortem plate.                CONCLUSION                The  multidisciplinary  nature  of  forensic  anthropology  involves  collaboration             with  forensic  pathologists,  odontologists,  geneticists,  and  law  enforcement              agencies to ensure comprehensive analysis and interpretation of evidence. There             have been numerous instances where Forensic Anthropology was used as a tool              for investigation and victim identification, for eg., the 9/11 World Trade Centre             Attack,  2002  Bali  bombing,  2004  Tsunami  and  so  on.  The  knowledge  of              forensic anthropologists is essential for conducting accurate and timely victim             identification during large-scale disasters, which frequently results in the closure              to the victims families.

Lipsticks              are made up of wax, emollients, and oil, and several pigments are used to impart             pigments  to  them.  But  nowadays,  harmful  substances  like  petroleum-based             chemicals, preservatives, and antioxidants are present as ingredients in lipsticks.              Lipsticks  are  one  of  the  most  crucial  pieces  of  trace  evidence  in  the  field  of              forensic science. Lipstick samples can be categorized and analyzed using ATR-             FTIR  spectroscopy,  Raman  spectroscopy,  and  other  multivariate  statistical              methods.                INTRODUCTION                Skincare  and  cosmetics  are  some  of  the  latest  trends.  And  when  it  comes  to             cosmetics, lip cosmetics like lipsticks and lip balms are used by both men and              women. Lipsticks are made up of both organic and inorganic substances. It is a             major part of everyone's routine, but the sad reality is that the majority of the              substances used in lipsticks are not safe to use. Lips are one of the sensitive parts             of the human body and they absorb the products applied to it through the skin              layers. The lips are not protected by hair, wax, or sweat glands making it less             vulnerable to natural defences like other parts of the body. When continuously              exposed  to  these  substances  it  could  lead  to  long-term  health  issues.  The              majority of the time lipsticks are ingested to the body by unknowingly licking it             and the carcinogenic ingredients are also ingested.

Criminal identification in different cases               like rape, burglary, and murder is done with the help of biological, physical,               and trace evidence. Stains like blood, saliva, semen, and lipstick marks are also              common  evidence  present  in  the  crime  scene  on  the  clothes  of  the  victim  or               culprit, tissues left behind, skin, different surfaces, and even on cigarette buts.

For               example, methylparaben is restricted in Europe because of the cancer risks it              poses. But these ingredients               often fall under the category of hidden ingredients which means it’s impossible               for consumers to be aware of the toxic substances present in them.                FORENSIC PERSPECTIVES LIPSTICK                  Earlier  cosmetic  smears  were  considered  futile  and  ineffective  but  now  it  is              considered major physical evidence since it’s easily transferred during crimes.                 Analytical techniques used in the examination of lipsticks are:                    Thin layer chromatography (TLC)                   Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy(AAS)                    High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)                   Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)                    High-resolution  continuum  source  graphite  furnace  atomic  emission                   spectroscopy (ICP-OES)                    Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS)                   Neutron activation analysis (NAA)                    Raman spectroscopy                   ATR-FTIR              VERITAS VOLUME: 3, ISSUE: 2                     WRITERS: ANANYA SUBRAMANIAN, RAKESH S","79                        Most of these are used for elemental analysis which depicts the threshold value              of heavy metals present in it except FTIR and Raman spectroscopy.               The majority of these techniques have limitations like TLC, GC-MS, and NAA               are  destructive  in  nature.  Lip  prints  can  have  saliva  DNA  in  the  print.  Lip              cosmetics  are  an  excellent  source  of  salivary  DNA  analysis  which  shows  the               biochemical and proteins found in blood. It can also provide information on              the diseases present in the body and the mouth of the host including diabetes               and heart diseases.                 LIMITATIONS                 Previous  research  works  on  this  topic  contain  insufficient  data  and  require  a              detailed  study  of  lipsticks  to  effectively  characterize  them.  And  to  link  an               unknown sample there is a need for databases of lipstick samples or a statistical               model. However, no studies have been done on the lipstick samples from the              Indian market for the local brands available.                      CONCLUSION                 Exposing yourself to a small amount of lipstick is not harmful, but if you are               someone  who  uses  it  regularly  and  frequently  reapplies,  it  can  cause  harm.              When lipstick samples were analyzed using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, which is               a non-destructive process, results were obtained and were able to predict their              respective brands, proving discrimination of lipstick samples is possible.                 In the future, there are chances of creating a database of lipstick samples, which               will help in identifying lipstick samples and establish connections between the              culprit and victim to solve a crime.

This  has  advantages              and disadvantages for forensic investigations. The advantages of this field are               that they are non-invasive and do not involve cutting the body. They save time              by eliminating the need for autopsy and tissue sampling, they allow for remote               analysis by multiple experts. But on the same side the downside is that virtual              autopsies can be expensive, they do not allow the collection of tissue samples.               The  challenges  of  interpreting  image  results  from  virtual  autopsies  require               expertise in radiology and forensic pathology.

Virtual  autopsy  or  Virtopsia,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  specialised  machine-               assisted autopsy that helps determine the cause, manner, etc. Virtual autopsy              (VIRTOPSY)  is  a  non-invasive  forensic  examination.  It  can  objectively  and               accurately  reflect  bone  fracture,  soft  tissue  injury,  injury  extent  and  organ              damage and provides intuitive and effective evidence for forensic identification.

These  scans  collect  information  about  internal  structures,  including  organs,               bones and tissues. Once the picture information is obtained it is prepared by a              computer  program  and  an  advanced  reproduction  of  the  body  is  made.               Through the powerful combination of these research methods, it was possible              to justify the most appropriate approaches to standardizing viropsis results for               effective crime investigation.                 Advantages of Virtual Autopsies              They are non-invasive which diminishes the require for obtrusive methods and               minimizes the hazard of defilement or harm to the body. In expansion virtual               post-mortem  examinations  can  give  a  more  intensive  and  point  by  point              examination of a body. The high-resolution images created by virtual. Virtual              autopsies  also  allow  for  detailed  3D  reconstructions  of  the  body  allowing               forensic experts to examine the anatomy from different angles and potentially               uncover evidence that may have been missed during a traditional autopsy.                 Limitations of Virtual Autopsies              One of the most important limitations is the need for expensive equipment and               specially trained technicians for imaging and data processing. They may not be              able  to  diagnose  certain  types  of  natural  deaths.  In  addition,  the  detail  and               accuracy  of  virtual  autopsies  may  not  yet  match  the  level  of  traditional              autopsies  especially  when  it  comes  to  identifying  subtle  tissue  changes  or               performing histological studies.                 Legal Considerations              The use of virtual autopsy evidence in research is still relatively new and raises               several legal considerations. Therefore, there is a need to establish standards for              the acceptability and authentication of virtual autopsy evidence. Courts must               determine the reliability and validity of virtual autopsy techniques and ensure               that they meet the necessary legal standards.        VERITAS VOLUME: 3, ISSUE: 2                                           WRITER: MERIEN ABRAHAM","83                  DISCUSSION                 Virtual  autopsies  have  received  considerable  attention  and  recognition  in               forensic  science  due  to  their  various  advantages.  Remote  access  to  virtual              autopsy  data  allows  forensic  findings  from  different  locations  to  be               collaboratively analysed and provide insights without being physically present.              Although  further  development  and  standardization  are  needed  to  address               current limitations the evolving role of virtual autopsy in forensic practice is a              promising development that warrants continued investigation and research.                CONCLUSION                  Virtual  autopsies  represent  a  significant  advancement  in  forensic  science  and              offer  a  non-invasive  alternative  to  traditional  autopsies.  Although  virtual              autopsies  have  several  advantages,  including  their  non-invasive  nature  and               ability  to  provide  detailed  imaging  they  also  have  limitations.

A scientific approach to examining human remains found from crime               scenes is called Forensic Taphonomy ,a branch under Forensic Anthropology.               Forensic  Taphonomy  is  therefore  essentially  the  study  and  analysis  of              postmortem modifications to the body. It helps in reconstruction of events that              occurred  between  the  deposition  of  remains  and  their  recovery.  It  can  be               described as the integration of Archeology and Forensic science expertise.The               estimation of postmortem interval can be done by using Forensic Taphonomic              techniques.It is also known as time since death,which is a time period between               death and recovery and examination of body.It can give informations such as              when  crime  was  committed  and  helps  investigators  to  reconstruct  the  death               scene.Several researches are happening in the field of forensic taphonomy since              it has an important role in solving a crime.

The  police  arrives  at  the  scene  for               investigation.Even though the examination of body should be done by a person               who  is  expert  in  that  field.  Here  comes  the  role  of  forensic  taphonomy.  The              term “taphonomy” was derived from two Greek words “taphos” which means               burial and “onomy” meaning the system of rules or law.It was first coined by a              Russian paleontologist Ivan Efremov in 1940s.

It refers to the               study of processes that happens to biological organisms from the time of death               to the time of finding it.

Forensic taphonomy is the term used in medico legal context, which studies the               postmortem processes, its preservation, recovery, which aids in reconstructing              the  factors  or  circumstances  that  may  lead  to  death.  Human  remains  go               through certain series of taphonomic processes which are affected by various              factors.The major environmental factors which affects the decomposition of a               body  includes  temperature,  humidity  and  pH  of  soil.  By  applying  forensic              taphonomic  techniques,An  investigator  can  determine  postmortem  interval,               perimortem and postmortem processes and also in distinction of natural from               human induced trauma. Approach to forensic taphonomy can be done through              two  aspects.  It  includes  geological  aspects,  which  studies  how  a  person  who              buries  a  body  affects  the  surrounding  environment  and  how  the  body  gets               affected  by  surrounding  geological  environment[Geotaphonomy]  and               Biological  aspects  to  study  how  the  body  remains'  tissues  get              decomposed[Biotaphonomy].                 Decomposition of Body after Death:               Decomposition can be described as a natural process in which body organs and              its  assemblages  breakdown  into  less  complicated  organic  matters.Soft  tissues               are the first to become modified after death. The postmortem changes occurring              to soft tissues can be denoted by 3 stages; Algor mortis, Livor mortis and Rigor               mortis.                 Algor mortis: It is the process of cooling of body after death. The rate at which              temperature cools down depends on temperature differential between the body               and the environment, but in general body cools at the rate of about 0.8 degrees              Celsius per hour during the first 12 hours after death.

Estimation of PMI in Forensic Taphonomy:              The estimation of Post Mortem Interval is very crucial since it can narrow the               pool of descendants, helps in identification, confirms or refuse reports and also              circumstances that lead to death. As the time period increases[months years], it               may cause errors in finding the potential cause of death. In this case, the PMI               can be estimated by analysing the decomposition of soft tissues and hard tissues              of skeleton. Post mortem interval can be estimated through following ways;          VERITAS VOLUME: 3, ISSUE: 2                                          WRITER: SAJAN SAHADEVAN","90                     1. With reference to ADD:                Since  temperature  is  the  major  factor  which  affects  decomposition  rate,  the               PMI can be estimated with reference to Accumulated Degree Days [ADD]. It               refers to the sum of average daily temperature usually in°C for a given number              of days with reference to a threshold temperature. Usually 0°C is considered as              the  threshold  temperature  for  decomposition  study.  In  these  calculations  of               ADD  and  estimation  of  PMI,  any  temperature  below  0°C  threshold  is               considered as 0 [freezing temperature inhibits bacterial growth].                 2. By quantifying the degree of decomposition using scoring system:                            PMI can be estimated by quantifying the degree of decomposition               using scoring system based on certain features              such as discoloration, bloating, purging and amount of soft tissues remaining.               Different scoring system is designated to different areas of body Which gives a              summed score called Total Body Score or TBS. With the help of this score an               analyst can estimate ADD. If you have Total Body Score the ADD can be find              out using the following equation. PMI can be estimated with the reference to               ADD.

Developments in this area have been essential for comprehending postmortem              procedures and supporting law enforcement inquiries. Among the most recent               developments are:                 Microbial Forensics: It is becoming more and more crucial to comprehend how              bacteria function in the processes of degradation.

There  are  different              strategies  that  fraudsters  utilize  to  misdirect  protections  companies  and               policyholders,  driving  to  expanded  premiums  for  legitimate  clients.  One               common  strategy  is  arranging  mishaps  or  wounds  to  form  wrong  claims  for              financial  gain.  Another  strategy  is  expanding  the  esteem  of  misplaced  or               harmed  property  in  arrange  to  get  the  next  payout  from  the  protections              company.  To  address  this  developing  issue,  protections  companies  are               contributing in innovation and information analytics to distinguish suspicious              claims  and  patterns  of  false  behaviour.  It  is  basic  for  all  partners  within  the               protections industry to work together to combat extortion and ensure genuine              policyholders from the budgetary results of misleading hones.
